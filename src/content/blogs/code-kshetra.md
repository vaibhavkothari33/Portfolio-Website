# Code Kshetra 2.0 – A Journey into Web3 & Blockchain 🚀

Hackathons are always an exhilarating experience, but **Code Kshetra 2.0** was something truly special. Held at JIMS Sector-5 Rohini, this 36-hour hackathon brought together some of the brightest minds in the tech space, and I had the absolute privilege of participating alongside my amazing teammates **Shrijan Katiyar, Abhigya, and Navya**.

Together, we embarked on a journey into the world of **Web3, blockchain, and reactive smart contracts**, building something innovative from scratch.

## **Introducing BlockBinge: A Decentralized Streaming Revolution** 🎬

Our project, **BlockBinge**, is a **decentralized, Web3-based streaming platform** that introduces a **pay-as-you-watch** model. Unlike traditional platforms that charge a one-time subscription fee, BlockBinge ensures that users **only pay for the minutes they watch**, making content consumption more **fair and flexible**.

 
### **Tech Stack & Learning Experience**

Building BlockBinge was not just about coding; it was a deep dive into **blockchain, smart contracts, and reactive smart contracts**. We started from scratch, learning about:

✅ **Smart contracts** to enable secure and transparent transactions.

✅ **IPFS for decentralized storage** to eliminate centralized hosting issues.

✅ **Reactive smart contracts**, thanks to **Harsh Kasna**, who helped us understand the Reactive Network.

✅ **Web3.js and Solidity**, which powered our blockchain interactions.

It was an incredible learning curve, and we are beyond proud of what we achieved in such a short time! 🚀

 
## **Hackathon Experience: Innovation, Networking & Fun!**

Beyond coding, the hackathon was an amazing experience. The **event was flawlessly managed**, ensuring we could focus on innovation. And let's not forget the **amazing food** that kept us going through the sleepless nights! 🍕🔥

A massive **thank you to Reactive** for the awesome goodies—I’m loving the **new mouse**! 🖱️😁 And a **special shoutout to Arnav Gupta** for the last-minute hustle to get our team in. Your support meant everything!


## **Awaiting the Results... Hope for the Best!** 🤞

While we eagerly await the **results for our track**, one thing is clear—this hackathon was a **game-changer** for us. Regardless of the outcome, we walk away with **new skills, new friends, and an experience to cherish**.

💡 Looking forward to taking our **Web3 and blockchain journey** even further!
